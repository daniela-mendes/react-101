# Learn React

Learn React is an online course taught by Bob Ziroll, on Scrimba.

It consisted of six different projects, the first four to teach different aspects of React, and the last two were capstone projects, built from zero, allowing us to apply what we had learn previously.

All orject were developed with React and TypeScript. Vite was used as a build tool to quickly create the web applications with pre-configured default settings, enabling us to start the projects without the hassle of complex setup.
